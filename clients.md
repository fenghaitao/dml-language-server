# Implementing clients

A short guide to implementing DLS support in your favourite editor.

Typically you will need to implement an extension or plugin in whatever format
and language your editor requires.

If your editor has a LSP-supporting library, then this will be much more straightforward. Implementing a client without the support of a library is outside the scope of this document.

## Preliminaries

Check with the maintainers of this repo to see if support already exists or is in development. If you start developing support for some editor, it is good to inform us so that we can track this.

If you encounter bugs or unexpected behaviour while implementing a client, please file an issue or create a PR.

## Where there is existing LSP support

If your editor has LSP support, then getting up and running is relatively easy. You
need a way to run the DLS and point the editor's LSP client at it. Hopefully
that is only a few lines of code. The next step is to ensure that the DLS gets
re-started after a crash - the LSP client may or may not do this automatically
(VSCode will do this five times before stopping).

Once you have this basic support in place, the hard work begins:

* Implement [extensions to the protocol]contributing.md#extensions-to-the-language-server-protocol)
* Client-side configuration.
  - You'll need to send the `workspace/didChangeConfiguration` notification when
    configuration changes.
  - For the config options, see [config.rs](../dls/src/config.rs#L99-L111)
* Check for and install the DLS
  - Download the latest [released binary](https://github.com/intel/dml-language-server.git/releases), you should regularly check for newly released binaries and update accordingly.
* Client-side features
  - e.g., code snippets, build tasks, syntax highlighting
* Testing
* Ensure alignment with existing DML semantics
  - e.g., syntax highlighting
* 'Marketing'
  - because we want people to actually use the extension
  - documentation - users need to know how to install and use the extension
  - keep us informed about status so we can advertise it appropriately
  - keep the DLS website updated
  - submit the extension to the editor package manager or marketplace

## Where there is no LSP support

If your editor has no existing LSP support, you'll need to do all the above plus
implement (parts of) the LSP. This is a fair amount of work, but probably not as
bad as it sounds. The LSP is a fairly simple JSON over stdio protocol. The
interesting bit is tying the client end of the protocol to functionality in your
editor.

### Required message support

The DLS currently requires support for the following messages. Note that we
often don't use anywhere near all the options, so even with this subset, you
don't need to implement everything.

Notifications:

* `exit`
* `initialized`
* `textDocument/didOpen`
* `textDocument/didChange`
* `textDocument/didSave`
* `workspace/didChangeConfiguration`
* `workspace/didChangeWatchedFiles`
* `cancel`

Requests:

* `shutdown`
* `initialize`
* `textDocument/definition`
* `textDocument/references`
* `textDocument/documentSymbol`
* `workspace/symbol`

From Server to client:

* `client/registerCapability`
* `client/unregisterCapability`

The DLS also uses some [custom messages](contributing.md#extensions-to-the-language-server-protocol).

## Resources

* [LSP spec](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specification)
* [contributing.md](contributing.md) - overview of the DLS and how to build, test, etc.
