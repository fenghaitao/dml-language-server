# Change Log

## 0.9.9
- Fixed an issue that could cause analysis thread crash when an object was declared both
  as an array and not one
- Added LSP protocol extension notification "changeActiveContexts" and request
  "getKnownContexts" which together can be used to determine and control the active
  device contexts for the server.
- Moved warning feedback when syntactic/semantic analysis is not available to
  server output from server message
- Goto-definition/declaration/implementation/references will now try to wait
  for ongoing device analysis on the file before responding.

## 0.9.8
- Added "warning" as a valid log statement type.
- Added warning feedback through LSP messages when analysis might be unavailable
  or only partially complete
-- When isolated/device (also known as syntactic/semantic) analysis is not available
-- When requesting symbol information about types
-- When requesting symbol or reference information about symbols or references from
   inside an uninstantiated template

  or 'never'
