# The DML language server

This repository is a place holder repository for a [Device Modeling Languge](https://github.com/intel/device-modeling-language) [Language Server](https://langserver.org/). As that is a mouthful, it'll most likely be called DLS at some point.

The language server will be implemented in Rust and our intent is to provide pre-built binaries for Linux and Windows. Any editor that supports the [LSP protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/) shall be able to use it, but we are also implementing a [VS-code Simics Modelling Extension](https://github.com/intel/vscode-simics) (also still in intial development) in which it is to be integrated.

The current expectation is that we'll publish a work-in-progress version around end of 24Q3. 

Please stay tuned!
