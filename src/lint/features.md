# Supported Rules

Below are listed the currently supported rules for linting:

## Spacing
- **SP.braces**: spaces around braces (`{` and `}`)
- **SP.punct**: spaces after but not before colon, semicolon and comma
- **NSP.funpar**: no spaces between a function/method name and its opening parenthesis
- **NSP.inparen**: no spaces immediately inside parentheses or brackets
- **NSP.unary**: no spaces between a unary operator and its operand
- **NSP.TrailingWhitespace**: no spaces between the last token in a line and the corresponding newline `\n`

## Line Length
- **LL1**: Lines should be kept shorter than 80 characters. Longer lines wrap or become partially invisible in editors whose windows have the standard width of 80 columns, which makes the code much harder to read
