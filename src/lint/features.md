# Supported Rules

Below are listed the currently supported rules for linting:

## Spacing
- **SP.braces**: spaces around braces (`{` and `}`)
- **SP.punct**: spaces after but not before colon, semicolon and comma
- **NSP.funpar**: no spaces between a function/method name and its opening parenthesis
- **NSP.inparen**: no spaces immediately inside parentheses or brackets
- **NSP.unary**: no spaces between a unary operator and its operand
- **NSP.TrailingWhitespace**: no spaces between the last token in a line and the corresponding newline `\n`

## Line Length
- **LL1**: Lines should be kept shorter than 80 characters. This limit can be set to a custom value
